- Support grouping tests (i.e. fixtures)

- Support SetUp/TearDown (test and fixture level)

- Integer asserts for <, <=, >, >= operators

- String assert using LIKE operator

- DateTime asserts for <, <=, >, >= operators

- Support wider output in batch mode (global vars table?)

- Use transactions to avoid needing a TearDown

- See if DDL trigger can be used to auto drop test procedures to avoid creation failure

- Denote helper procedures so they can be auto dropped too.
