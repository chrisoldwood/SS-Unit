- Add error handling for fixture set up/tear down errors (all tests failed if tear down fails?)

- See if DDL trigger can be used to auto drop test procedures to avoid creation failure

- Denote helper procedures so they can be auto dropped too (fixture sufficent?)

- Better handling of displayWidth in tests (string and parse in Run() or helper function?)

- Strip fixture name from test results (separate column?)

- Don't report detailed results just Pass/Fail counts.
