- Add error handling for fixture set up/tear down errors (all tests failed if tear down fails?)

- See if DDL trigger can be used to auto drop test procedures to avoid creation failure

- Denote helper procedures so they can be auto dropped too (fixture sufficent?)

- Better handling of displayWidth in tests (string and parse in Run() or helper function? sql_variant?)

- Global settings table and procs to handle display width, report summary etc.
